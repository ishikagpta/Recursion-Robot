# Recursion-Robot
Project from Applied Algorithmics/Data structures, algorithms, and discrete math course

Summary 

The programming assignment will provide an exercise in using recursion.  There are two problems which need to be solved.  The first asks for a recursive function to calculate a Catalan number.  The second is to solve a path-finding problem in two dimensional space.  The assignment will require the usage of recurrence as well as good class design.
